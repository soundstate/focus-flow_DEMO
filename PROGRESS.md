## Current Status

The Focus Engine service foundation is now **complete** with:

### Core Features Implemented:
- **FastAPI application** with proper configuration and middleware
- **Database integration** with SQLAlchemy ORM models
- **Session management** with full CRUD operations
- **WebSocket support** for real-time session updates
- **Service layer architecture** with business logic separation
- **Comprehensive validation** and input sanitization
- **Timer utilities** for session calculations and formatting
- **Enhanced error handling** and structured logging

### API Endpoints Available:
- `POST /sessions/` - Start a new focus session
- `POST /sessions/{id}/pause` - Pause an active session  
- `POST /sessions/{id}/resume` - Resume a paused session
- `POST /sessions/{id}/complete` - Complete a session
- `GET /sessions/{id}` - Get session details
- `GET /sessions/user/{user_id}` - Get user's recent sessions
- `GET /sessions/user/{user_id}/active` - Get user's active session
- `DELETE /sessions/{id}` - Delete a session
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoints
- `WS /ws/session/{id}` - WebSocket for real-time updates

### Technical Architecture:
- **Models**: SQLAlchemy database models + Pydantic API schemas
- **Services**: Business logic layer with session state management
- **Routers**: FastAPI route handlers with proper error handling
- **Utils**: Timer calculations, validation, and utility functions
- **WebSockets**: Real-time session broadcasting functionality
- **Configuration**: Environment-based settings with logging

## Repository Information

- **GitHub URL**: https://github.com/soundstate/focus-flow_DEMO
- **Primary Branch**: main
- **Current Commit**: Focus Engine service foundation complete
- **Services Architecture**: Microservices with FastAPI + React frontend

## Development Notes

The project follows enterprise-grade development practices with:
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Input validation and sanitization
- Service layer architecture for business logic
- Database ORM with proper migrations support
- WebSocket integration for real-time features
- Environment-based configuration management
- Full test coverage preparation (test directories in place)

The Focus Engine service is production-ready for basic session management and can now be extended with advanced features or integrated with other services and the frontend application.
