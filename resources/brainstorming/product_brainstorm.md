# Weekly Schedule App - Product Brainstorm

## Overview

A personalized weekly scheduling app that helps users balance mandatory commitments with health, personal development, relationships, and downtime. The app learns user preferences and adapts schedules based on goals, personality type, and weekly feedback.

---

## Core Concept

### Primary Goals

- Help users create sustainable, balanced weekly schedules
- Adapt to changing priorities week-to-week and month-to-month
- Provide insights and encouragement through weekly summaries
- Allow users to set long-term goals and track progress over time

### Key Integrations & Technology

- **Gamification**: Integrated Pomodoro timer with productivity tracking. Achievements, streaks, and progress bars to motivate users.
- **Music Integration**: YouTube Music API for focus-enhancing playlists
- **AI/ML**: Learn user preferences, optimize scheduling, provide productivity insights and recommendations
- **Notifications**: Push notifications (mobile and desktop) for focus sessions and breaks
- **Frontend Architecture**: Enterprise-grade React patterns for scalability and maintainability

### Onboarding Philosophy

- **Full Onboarding**: Detailed questionnaire for highly personalized scheduling
- **Quick Start Option**: Core default schedule for users who want to start immediately
  - Includes basic time blocks for: work, health, personal development, relationships, chores, fun, and downtime
  - Can be customized later as user engages with the app

---

## Key Features

### 1. Initial Setup & Onboarding

#### Quick Start vs. Full Onboarding

- Users choose their onboarding depth
- Quick Start: Default schedule with minimal questions
- Full Onboarding: Comprehensive personalization (detailed below)

#### Core Onboarding Elements

**Off-Days Selection**

- User chooses one or more days off per week

**Mandatory Time Blocking**

- Capture fixed commitments (work schedule, childcare, etc.)
- These time blocks are locked and cannot be changed by the user
- Foundation for all schedule generation

**Priority Assessment**

- User ranks priority of the following categories:
  - Health
  - Personal Development
  - Relationships
  - Chores
  - Fun
  - Downtime

**Time Allocation Preferences**

- User specifies desired weekly hours for each non-mandatory category
- Helps app understand ideal time distribution

**Chronotype Assessment**

- Is user a morning person or night person?
- Do they want to change this about themselves?
- Used to optimize schedule timing and suggest gradual shifts if desired

**Personality & Lifestyle Questionnaire**

- Progressive detail levels: User can choose how deep they want to go
- Basic questions:
  - How much downtime do they need?
  - What are their main priority areas? (health, personal development, relationships, etc.)
  - Are they in a relationship that needs dedicated time?
- Advanced questions (optional):
  - [Research existing personality frameworks to quantify user preferences]
  - [Add progressively detailed questions that users can opt into]
  - [Consider including elements from: Big Five, MBTI, productivity styles, etc.]

### 2. Goal Setting

#### Health Goals

- User goals and priorities
- Personality preferences (morning/night person, downtime needs)
- Time allocation preferences
- Off-days

#### Dynamic Schedule Adjustments

**Weekly Modifications**

- User can adjust current week's schedule when priorities shift
- App uses base schedule as foundation
- Intelligently redistributes time based on what's being prioritized
- Maintains balance across categories when possible

- **User Setting Options**:
  1. **Always Update**: Automatically push next activities back
  2. **Never Update**: Time is lost from next activity (strict schedule)
  3. **Prompt Each Time**: Ask user to decide in the moment

**Considerations**:

- How do downstream activities get affected?
- Should there be a max "flex time" allowed per day?
- Can certain activities be marked as "flexible" vs. "rigid"?

#### Productivity Tracking & Analytics

**Weekly Summary**

## Notes & Additional Ideas

### Research Needed

- Existing personality frameworks for questionnaire (Big Five, MBTI, chronotype research)
- Best practices for Pomodoro timer apps
- YouTube Music API capabilities and limitations
- Competitor analysis (existing schedule/productivity apps)
- Academic research on schedule adherence and habit formation

### Future Feature Ideas

- Give users the ability to share their schedules with friends/family
- Voice control integration (Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa)
- Apple Watch / Wear OS app for quick timer control
- Email digest option instead of/in addition to push notifications
- "Focus Mode" that automatically enables Do Not Disturb
- Integration with email (time-block for email processing)
- Habit tracking integration
- Journal/reflection prompts after focus sessions
- AI-generated motivational messages
- Collaborative scheduling (family/team schedules)
- Weather-aware scheduling (outdoor activities)

### Design Inspiration

- [Add links to apps with good UX]
- [Color palette ideas]
- [Typography choices]

### Random Thoughts

- integrate various options for some kind of character that the user takes care of by completing focus sessions and sticking to their schedule. for example a tomagotchi-style character that grows and evolves as the user completes tasks and maintains streaks. this could add an additional layer of gamification and motivation. there could be add-ons for different character types or themes that users can unlock through achievements or in-app purchases.
