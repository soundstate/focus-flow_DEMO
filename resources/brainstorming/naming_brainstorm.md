## Overview

The purpose of this app is to help users **plan their week ahead of time** by taking into account requirements, goals, and health factors — then follow that schedule throughout the week **without having to think about it**.  
It allows users to go on **“autopilot”**, much like **meal prepping** for time.

The day **Sunday** serves as a conceptual anchor — it’s the natural reset point for reviewing the previous week and setting up the next one.

The name should:

- Be **short and lowercase**
- Convey **simplicity, rhythm, and flow**
- Optionally connect to the **soundstate** brand ecosystem (which includes `structure.` and `standard.`)
- Optionally fit the **“S-theme”** naming pattern, though this is not required
